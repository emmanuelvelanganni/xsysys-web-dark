											HE Mrs. Fientje Moerman. the key-note speaker, was happy to see <span class="xsysys_style">xsysys</span> which has its roots in Flanders, growing and flourishing here in Bangalore. In her speech, the minister also stressed on the fact that <span class="xsysys_style">xsysys</span> has given a positive look to outsourcing by setting up a whole new independent unit in Bangalore to support its parent company back in Belgium. Mrs. Fientje Moerman also mentioned that the Trade Mission would like to strengthen and intensify ties with cities like Bangalore and diversify and expand in other fundamental areas besides gems and jewelries trade. Consequent to this idea, the minister concluded with the note that already a draft of the text of a Declaration of Intent was exchanged with the Chief Minister of Karnataka.

										A new office to promote Global Virtual Enterprise concept
									</h1>
									<p>
										In order to support our international activities at <span class="xsysys_style">xsysys</span> Technologies, we have established a new office near Electronics City in Bangalore, says the Managing Director, Carl Dujardin.
									</p>
									<p>
										Our new facility has a built up area of more than 16000 sqft and we can quickly ramp up in a second phase of development to approximately 33000 sqft.
									</p>
									<p>
										In addition to being the development and project unit for DeDuCo nv and DeDuCo Europe nv – Belgium,
									</p>
									<p>
										<span class="xsysys_style">xsysys</span> Technologies will also focus on international outsourcing activities launching its Global Virtual Office Concept.
									</p>
									<p>
										"The purpose of the new office was to upgrade our existing work space to global standards in order to improve our efficiency", explains Carl Dujardin. "In addition, it will facilitate us to fulfill outsourcing assignments for our international clients, giving them more scope to concentrate on the core aspect of their business. The new office has already proven its value."
									</p>
									<p>
										According to Carl Dujardin, the investment into a brand new office and the name change from DeDuCo Software Systems India to <span class="xsysys_style">xsysys</span> Technologies are part of a new integral strategic plan and it is a typical example of what is required from companies ready to adapt to fundamental changes in their business ecosystem.
									</p>
									<p>
										"We believe that our new office was an essential step in the right direction towards the aspired growth of our organization. Having in mind that Bangalore has an extremely rich talent pool of intellectuals and modern thinkers, we know the future is bright for <span class="xsysys_style">xsysys</span> Technologies."
